# Tank War

Based on the old good tanks game Battle City, Tank War is my very first 'full game'. 

It features animated sprites, projectiles, collisions, A* pathfinding, incremental difficulty with levels,
two players, bonus weapons, 4 season ambiented phases with 'boss fight' on the last level of each, 
gamepad controller control, and more!
